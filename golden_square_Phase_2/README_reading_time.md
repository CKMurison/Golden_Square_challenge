# Word Count Method

The word count method is a Ruby method that estimates the reading time for a text, assuming that the reader can read 200 words per minute. This method was created to  help users manage their time by providing an estimate of how long it will take them to read a given text.

## To use the Word Count Method

It simply pass a string of text as an argument to the method. the method will then count the number of words in the text and divine it by 200 to calculate the estimated reading time in minutes. The result will be returned as a floating point number with two decimal places.

This methods was developed using Test-Driven Development(TDD) in collaboration with Cameron Murison and Chayada Sansiriwong. A spec file was created to test the functionality of the method and ensure that it meets the requirements of the given task.

We hope that this method will be useful to anyone who wants to manage their time more effectively when reading texts.
